    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Jesse Clapper. I'm a (super) senior of Computer Science at the University at Buffalo and one of the programmers working on Curator.<br>
    I'm a big internet lurker who likes to explore and investigate things in the digital jungle of the internet. I'm also generally a big gamer and enjoy lots of media.<br>
    As for more relevant things I'm primarily a Python programmer with an interest in front-end web development, as well as data processing and database management.</p>

    <p>Anyways, that's enough for now. It's a busy semester for me so sorry but I'm not able to put so much time in a page like this.<br>Hope whoever is reading this has a good day though.</p>
